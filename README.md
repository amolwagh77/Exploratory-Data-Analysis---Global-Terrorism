# Global Terrorism Database (GTD) Analysis

The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) is an open-source database containing information on terrorist attacks worldwide from 1970 through 2017. This project aims to explore and analyze the GTD to discover key insights and trends related to terrorist activities.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the GTD dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the data. The analysis will focus on understanding the following aspects:
- Year-wise trends in terrorist attacks
- Regional and country-wise distribution of attacks and casualties
- City-specific analysis of terrorist incidents
- Analysis of terrorist groups and their activities

## Main Libraries Used

- **Pandas:** For data manipulation, aggregation, and exploratory data analysis.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn:** For data visualization, plotting various charts, and exploring the behavior of variables.
- **NumPy:** For efficient numerical computations and operations on the data.

## Installation

To run the analysis and visualize the data, make sure you have Python installed along with the necessary libraries. You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy
